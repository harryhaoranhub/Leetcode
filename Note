1207. Unique Number of Occurrences
Given an array of integers arr, return true if the number of occurrences of each value in the array is unique or false otherwise.

class Solution:
    def uniqueOccurrences(self, arr: List[int]) -> bool:
        count_map = {}
        for num in arr:
            if num in count_map:
                count_map[num] += 1
            else:
                count_map[num] = 1

        occurrences_set = set(count_map.values())
        
        return len(occurrences_set) == len(count_map)
